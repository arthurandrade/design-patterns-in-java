# Strategy

The Strategy pattern is very useful when we have a set of similar algorithms, and we need to switch between them in different pieces of the application. Strategy gives us a flexible way to write several different algorithms, and pass these algorithms to client classes that need them. These clients are unaware of what "real" algorithm is running, and just tells the algorithm to run. This causes the client-side code to be quite decoupled from the actual implementations of algorithms, thus enabling this client to be able to work with N different algorithms without having to change its code.
